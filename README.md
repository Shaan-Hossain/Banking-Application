## Description
This application was created with Java and JavaFX, implementing the State Design Pattern, a file information system, Junit testing with abstraction functions and rep invariants
in order to emulate a practical Banking application where admins and end users(Customers) can use different interfaces, respectively, to manage and modify accounts. View UML diagram of this application [here](https://github.com/Shaan-Hossain/Banking-Application/blob/master/UMLDiagram.png).

## Motive behind Project
To implement my knowledge of Object-Oriented-Design Patterns, testing, error-handling, file management, and sorting algorithms.
