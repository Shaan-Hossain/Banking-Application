## Description
This application was created with Java and JavaFX, implementing the State Design Pattern, a file information system, Junit testing with abstraction functions and rep invariants
in order to emulate a practical Banking application where admins and end users (Customers) can use different interfaces, respectively, to manage and modify accounts. View UML diagram of this application [here](https://github.com/Shaan-Hossain/Banking-Application/blob/master/UMLDiagram.png).
## Why I did I build this project? 
To augment my knowledge of Object-Oriented-Design Patterns, testing, error-handling, file management, and sorting algorithms. 
## How to use application 
1. Open project with an IDE. 
2. Run the Main class to open the application 
3. Initally, there are no accounts within the information system, so you must log in as an admin (Username: admin, Password: admin) to create accounts for different arbitrary    customers. 
4. Then with the set username and password created for each customer through the admin, you can log into a customers account and modify the acccount by withdrawing,deposting, and purchasing.
